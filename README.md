# Advent of Code - 2024

This is my 2024 Advent of Code<sup>1</sup> (AoC) repository.

Yet another year where I'll be using Swift, my primary programming language, to complete the AoC challenges.

Similar to previous years, I will continue to time my functions and record their times in the `records.md` file. I will run each function a total of 10 times to calculate the average time it takes to execute each function. Unline last year, I will not be including I/O time as apart of my time records. So the time it takes to read the file and convert it into a string will not be included.

## Get Involved

I have created a private leaderboard on Advent of Code for up to 198 people to join, feel free to jump in and play along. Each day solving the 2 challenges earning stars. The private leaderboard's join code is `1048725-41c081f6` Once the 198 spots have been filled I will remove this portion of the readme, and at the end of the month post the top 5 people on the leaderboard.

**Note:** _The leaderboard is retro-active, so if you've already done the days leading up to the day you join, your points will still count._
